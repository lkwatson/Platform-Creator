# Platform Creator
This small program allows a user to attempt to fill defined boxes with a set of predefined tables. Built in Lua with Love2d. This program is very rudimentary, and the code is a bit old.

The intended application of this program is to allow a theatrical stage designer to draw a desired set of platforms, and
quickly create a draft of where smaller platforms can be placed together to form a multi-level stage

The greater scope of this program is its application in solving the NP-Hard "Bin Packing" problem. 

##How to use
Download the love2d application from https://love2d.org/
When compiled, having the love2d application isn't necessary.

The current controls are via the keyboard. Pressing "S" selects the square tool to draw squares that will be filled with
a set of platforms upon processing, by pressing the "P" key twice. Pressing the "L" key allows the user to draw lines, 
simply for the purpose of measurment.
